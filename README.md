# Convert-Base-Application
**This is Convert Base Application**
*This program is made to convert bases. which takes two numbers in two specific bases, for example 2 and 10, and converts it after taking the number*
*In this project, I used fragments, which use the viewPage feature of the application to turn pages*
*This application is used for those who want to do base conversion very quickly and cheat in the exam. This application is more useful for students because they are familiar with the concept of base conversion.*
